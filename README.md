## **Usage**

1. **Run Pre-Trained Models:**  
   Navigate to the folder containing the pre-trained model you want to use. Follow the instructions in the README or usage file within that directory.

   **Example:**

   ```bash
   python src/predict.py --model pre-trained-model-name --input data/input.csv
   ```

2. **Train a Model:**  
   Use the provided training scripts to train a model with your custom dataset.

   **Example:**

   ```bash
   python src/train_model.py --config config/model_config.yaml
   ```

3. **Visualizations:**  
   Run the Jupyter notebooks to visualize the dataset, model training metrics, and evaluation results.

   **Example:**

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook notebooks/model_analysis.ipynb
   ```
